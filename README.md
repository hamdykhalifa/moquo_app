# MoQuo!

MoQuo! is a React Native mobile application that allows you to write down your favorite quotes. 

You can not only add new quotes, but also get to the next or previous quote in your own personal list.

# Alert API
The Alert Api is included to warn you before deleting a quote in case you tapped the "Delete" button by mistake.

# Firebase
I chose firebase as a quick and easy to setup database for this project. It allows me to quickly store and retrieve data.
